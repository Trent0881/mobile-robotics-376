// of our class exampleActionServer.  Since this is a class method, we need to tell boost::bind that it is a class member,
// using the "this" keyword.  the _1 argument says that our executeCB takes one argument
// the final argument  "false" says don't start the server yet.  (We'll do this in the constructor)
