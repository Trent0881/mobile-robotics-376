# stdr_control
An minimal, example node to illustrate control of the STDR mobile robot with open-loop commands.

# Created by Trent Ziemer on Jan 31 2016 based on EECS 376 code examples.

# This package has one node, started by running rosrun msc msc, which starts the my_stdr_control utility to send commands to the STDR mobile robot.
# Assumed the simulator and robot are already up and running
