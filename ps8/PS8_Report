PS 8: Odometry and AMCL Steering

For this project I found out what nodes interfaced where annd on what topics they communicated on first. 
Then I launched those nodes from a single launch file I created to see what would happen. 
Given some test input locations I found out how to move the mobot in some directions. I used that to give it the actual location coordinates. 
From there, I fine tuned the control algorithm so the mobot would move as specified. Then I recorded a video of the mobot moving from start to the end of the hallway and then back to the original location.

To run, swap out the learning_ros files with my three copies, and then run "roslaunch .../path/to/a.launch"
