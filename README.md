Homework submissions for EECS 376 mobile robotics class

Packages are each a homework submission, with an abbreviated name for the problem assignment as it's name.
Each package has it's own instructions for launching necessary files.

All documents highly based on work provided courtesy of Dr. Wyatt Newman (and his learning_ros repository) as part of his class at CWRU.
Additional support provided from the EECS 376 class teachers assistants.

Reports and other materials for the class are NOT included in this repository, only source code I've made and packages for assignments.
